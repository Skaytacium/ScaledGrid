# ScaledGrid
## A scaled square grid which changes as per the variables
Only works with square grids as of right now because I am not the best mathematician

## How to use
Get the source code via `git clone https://github.com/skaytacium/scaledgrid.git` or download zip, and run run.bat

## Dependancies
1. Python 3.8/3.7 added to path
2. Pygame (type `pip install --user pygame` in a cmd shell)
